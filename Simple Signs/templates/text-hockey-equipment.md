    <div id="header">Hockey Equipment Donations</div>

    <div id="article">Mr. Smith is hoping that parents might be able to donate used hockey equipment 
    for next year's hockey intramurals starting
        in October. We are in need of used goalie equipment, i.e. pads, blockers, helmets, etc... 
        even an old net if that
        is something a family doesn't need. Our equipment at the moment is pretty banged up 
        and we would love to be able
        to provide better gear to the teams in the Fall. Many thanks.</div>
